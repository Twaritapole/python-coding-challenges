# 🐍 Python Programming Assignment

This repository contains solutions to fundamental **Python coding exercises** implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and standalone scripts.  
The exercises focus on **control structures, loops, functions, string handling, and user interaction**.

## 🔹 Exercises Covered

1. **Prime Number Checker**
   - A program to check whether a number is prime or not.

2. **Product of Random Numbers**
   - Generates two random numbers, asks the user to input their product, and verifies the answer.

3. **Squares of Even/Odd Numbers**
   - Prints the squares of either all even or all odd numbers in the range `100–200`.  
   - (Choice of even/odd is documented in the code.)

4. **Word Counter**
   - Counts the frequency of words in a given text.  
   Example:  
   Input: `"This is a sample text. This text will be used"`  
   Output:  

5. **Palindrome Checker**
- A function `is_palindrome()` that checks whether a string is a palindrome, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.  
Example: `"racecar"` → `True`

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter Notebook (`python_exercises.ipynb`) with all solutions in one place  
- `scripts/` → Individual `.py` scripts for each exercise  
- `requirements.txt` → Dependencies (minimal, standard Python libraries)

---

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries
- Python Standard Library (`random`, `string`)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## ✅ Example Outputs
- Prime check → Input: `7` → Output: `Prime`  
- Product of random numbers → Random: `6 × 4` → User: `24` → Output: `Correct!`  
- Squares of even numbers (100–200) → Prints values from `10000` to `40000+`  
- Word counter → Frequency dictionary output  
- Palindrome → `"madam"` → `True`  

---

## 🔮 Future Scope
- Add **unit tests** (`pytest`) for validation.  
- Extend exercises with file handling, exception handling, and recursion.  
- Convert into a small CLI or web-based app.
